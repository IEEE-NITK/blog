Music. Who doesn’t love music? Hanging around with headphones on,
earphones hooked to the ears and people travelling with volume up is
common these days, but these audio devices weren’t a fashion before 20
years. You might have heard your parents instinctively say “Hey, change
the plate” when they don’t seem to like the song you are playing only to
realize in a moment that it can be done with a single touch. Yes, they
were referring to a gramophone when they said ‘plate’ which you might
have seen in old movies. The sensation it created in the 20th century
and its resurgence in recent times after being replaced by digital
techniques makes the study of these outdated audio devices interesting.

## The Basic Idea

Sound is nothing but disturbance they create in the
travelling medium. The basic idea of the early record players is to
store these disturbances mechanically and use them to reproduce the
sound on a later date. First ever gramophone invented by Thomas Edison
stored these disturbances in a wooden cylinder wrapped with metal foil
by the means of tiny grooves whose depth varied in accordance with the
loudness of sound. While reproducing the sound a lightweight mechanical
bar like structure traverses over the grooves to produce small
vibrations which was amplified by a horn.

## Parts of a Gramophone

Later these cylinders were replaced with flat
vinyl discs, also called as ‘plates’ to make it compact and the
gramophone evolved to take the name of record player. A turnable, stylus
and a tonearm make up the skeleton of a typical record player. As its
name gives out the clue, turnable is responsible for rotating the vinyl
discs at a desired speed and the tonearm is the bar which terminates
with stylus and picks up the microscopic vibrations. Stylus is a needle
like structure, made with hard substance like diamond which is in
contact with the grooves of vinyl disc.

## Working

While recording the sound, stylus is placed on the inner end of
the vinyl disc. Sound waves are directed to the tonearm and
simultaneously disk is rotated. The radius of the position of the stylus
is gradually increased so as to fill the entire disc with grooves
representing the sound. While reproducing the recorded sound, the stylus
is placed on the disc at the position corresponding to our desired start
of the sound and rotated with the same speed. The tonearm vibrates due
to varying depth of grooves and the vibration of the tonearm is
amplified by the horn to produce desired loudness. The original disc is
pressed against an empty disc to create a master copy (negative) making
it favorable for mass production.

## Conclusion

Though these devices are bulky and have many limitations of
their own over digital, the reason they are making a sudden revival in
recent times is due to their openness of sound allowing more features of
music to be heard. The regaining popularity of the device among the
musical community is reflected by the drastic increase in the sales of
vinyl.
