SEEFOOD is an application which basically predicts if an image is an image of a hot-dog or not. This is based on the model used in the [HBO's Silicon Valley ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIci3C4JkL0).

This blog is a short tutorial on building this classfier model. Knowing the basics of Deep Learning, CNNs and Transfer learning would be helpful in following along.

### How to start ? 
First, we need to get a dataset for training the model. For this, there is a [dataset on kaggle ](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog) which perfectly matches our needs. So now that we have a dataset, we need to build and train the actual model.  
 
### Let's start coding. 
The notebook is [here](https://github.com/vinayakj02/SEEFOOD-classifier/blob/master/seefood_notebook.ipynb) if you want to follow through as you're reading the article. 

First, off we import all the required libraries.
```python

import torch 
from torchvision import datasets,transforms, models
from torch import optim , nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import torch.nn.functional as F 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


Before importing the dataset we can use a simple transform to ensure all our images and resized, center cropped, and convert into tensors. 
```python
transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(256),
                                 transforms.CenterCrop(224),
                                 transforms.ToTensor(),])

dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(root='gdrive/My Drive/seefood/train/',transform=transforms)
validation_set = datasets.ImageFolder(root='gdrive/My Drive/seefood/test/',transform=transforms)
```
<br>

Now we can import both the test and validation sets. Since the number of images here is not very high we can use a batch size of 20.

Once the dataset is loaded we can view the images. 
```python
trainLoader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=20,shuffle= True)
valLoader = DataLoader(validation_set,batch_size=20,shuffle=True )

data = iter(trainLoader)
images ,labels = next(data)
plt.imshow(images[0][0,:,:],cmap='gray')
plt.title(f"Label : {labels[0]}")
```

 </p>
 
### Building the model
Since we are dealing with images we would need to use a model which is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model itself would be a binary classifier to detect whether the food item is a "hot dog" or not. Smaller models with lower layers do not tend to work because they are simply not powerful enough to detect the different features, so we can see a good use case of transfer learning here. 

For this purpose we can use the densenet121 model, you can read more about Densely Connected Convolutional Networks in this paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993.pdf).
. Since we are only going to train the last block of the model we can freeze all the other parameters of the model.  
```python3
model = models.densenet121(pretrained=True)
for params in model.parameters():
  params.require_grad = False
#model.classifier -> Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=1000, bias=True)
```
If we take a look at the classifier currently we can see it's a classifier that has 1024 input features and 1000 output features. 
We can redefine this classifier for our case here. 

```python
classifier = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(1024,1024),nn.ReLU(),nn.Dropout(p=0.3),
                           nn.Linear(1024,512),nn.ReLU(),nn.Dropout(p=0.3),
                           nn.Linear(512,2),nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1))
model.classifier = classifier 

```
The classifier now, 
```
model.classifier -> Sequential(
  (0): Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=1024, bias=True)
  (1): ReLU()
  (2): Dropout(p=0.3, inplace=False)
  (3): Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=512, bias=True)
  (4): ReLU()
  (5): Dropout(p=0.3, inplace=False)
  (6): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=2, bias=True)
  (7): LogSoftmax(dim=1)
)
```


### Training the model
For the loss function here we can use the negative log-likelihood loss. Since we are training only the classifier part of the model, we need to include only the parameters from that block in the optimizer.
```python
loss_function = nn.NLLLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.classifier.parameters(), lr=0.003)
```


If you are trying to train the model, do make use of GPUs on google colab or kaggle. This speeds up the training process a lot. 
The standard training loop, 
```python
loss_graph , val_loss_graph , acc = [] , [] , []
for _ in range(6):
  running_loss = 0
  val_loss = 0
  device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
  model.train()

  for images, labels in trainLoader:

    images , labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    logits = model(images)
    loss = loss_function(logits,labels )
    running_loss += loss.item()
    loss.backward()

    optimizer.step()

  with torch.no_grad(): 
    model.eval()
    cor = 0
    total = 0

    for images,labels in valLoader:
      images , labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
      predictions = model(images)
      loss = loss_function(predictions, labels)
      val_loss += loss.item()

      for p,l in zip(torch.argmax(predictions,dim=1 ),labels):
        if p==l:
          cor +=1
        total +=1 

  loss_graph.append(running_loss/len(trainLoader))
  val_loss_graph.append(val_loss/len(valLoader))
  acc.append(cor*100/total)
  print(f'training loss : {running_loss/len(trainLoader)} , validation loss : {val_loss/len(valLoader)} , Accuracy : {cor*100/total}')
 ```

```training loss : 0.8344280552864075 , validation loss : 0.38366479575634005 , Accuracy : 87.4
training loss : 0.3701903349161148 , validation loss : 0.4923225581645966 , Accuracy : 76.2
training loss : 0.40178473711013796 , validation loss : 0.26429639220237733 , Accuracy : 90.2
training loss : 0.29359916508197786 , validation loss : 0.2639751332998276 , Accuracy : 89.6
training loss : 0.23448901653289794 , validation loss : 0.26386004567146304 , Accuracy : 89.6
```
### Result
On training it for about 6 epochs I got around 86% accuracy.

### Interesting question ?
Why do you think densenet121 was used for this model ?
