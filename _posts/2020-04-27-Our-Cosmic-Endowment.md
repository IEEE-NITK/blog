# **Our Cosmic Endowment**

The evolution of the Universe from Big Bang to galaxies, stars,
and planets has along the way created us. This evolutionary path
from raw quarks to thinking beings who seek to understand how
they fit into this grand scheme—what eighteenth-century scientists
called “the great chain of being”—is one of many marvels
of the Universe the existence of life on our own planet is suggestive
of the possibility of its existence elsewhere, and so we will also speculate about whether we are alone, leading to the question,
Do other intelligent civilizations exist? Astronomers are
strongly divided about such possibilities. Some argue that such
life is highly probable, whereas others argue that it is highly
improbable. some astronomers have been
motivated by such arguments to search for radio signals from
other civilizations.

## **LIFE ON EARTH**

the ancient life forms “cyanobacteria” (cyan is a blue-green
colour associated with these photosynthesizing cells) form colonies
called “stromatolites,” which are found in fossils more than
3 billion years old and look identical to the stromatolites that
exist today in shallow, warm, salty bays along the coast of western
Australia.
Scientists conclude from the fossil evidence that only
extremely simple life forms such as bacteria and algae existed
for roughly three-fourths of Earth’s history. Then, approximately
600 million years ago, more-complex forms such as
invertebrates developed, and about 500 million years ago, only
a little more than one-tenth of the Earth’s lifetime, shells and
crustaceans appeared. Mammals and dinosaurs both appeared
roughly 250 million years ago, but the latter were wiped out
about 65 million years ago in the great Cretaceous extinction,
probably caused by a totally chance event—an asteroidal collision,
our immediate
ancestors, appeared roughly 5.5 million years ago, but our own
species, Homo Sapiens, evolved only about 500,000 years ago.
Earth has therefore existed as a planet roughly 10,000 times
longer than we have as a species. Thus, if all Earth’s history
were compressed into a year, humans would appear only in the last hour, civilization only in the last few minutes, and a human
lifetime would be less than a second.

## **LIFE ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE**

Humans have speculated for thousands of years about life elsewhere
in the Universe. Around 300B.C., the ancient Greek
philosopher Epicurus wrote in his “Letter to Herodotus” that
“there are infinite worlds both like and unlike this world of
ours.” Epicurus went on to add that “in all worlds there are living
creatures and plants.”
Likewise, the Roman scholar Lucretius
wrote, around 50 B.C., that “it is in the highest degree unlikely
that this Earth and sky is the only one to have been created.”

## **SEARCHING FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE**

Is there any evidence for life elsewhere in the Universe? Not
really, although in the summer of 1996 two groups of scientists
suggested that traces of organic chemicals that they detected in
meteorites from Mars may indicate that life once existed there
Even if the Universe were teeming with life, we have so
far examined only a tiny portion of it: some half dozen spots
on the Moon and on Mars (by robot space-landers), and some
asteroidal fragments picked up on Earth. The Moon’s lack of
atmosphere and water make it so inhospitable that astronomers
did not expect to find life there. Mars seemed more promising
because its environment, though harsh, is more like the Earth’s
than that of any other planet in the Solar System.
Another intriguing possibility is that life may have formed in
the oceans under the icy crust of moons like Europa, Ganymede,
or Enceladus. Tidal and internal radioactive heating keep the interiors 
of these icy moon’s liquid
Conditions there may be similar to the ocean on the young Earth, with underwater
volcanic vents. Astronomers are considering how we
might deliver a deep-sea vehicle to explore one of these moons.
The hypothesis that terrestrial life descended from organisms
created elsewhere in the Universe is called pamspermia
According to this idea, simple life forms
from some other location drifted from their place of origin
across space to Earth. Bacteria spawned on some distant planet,
for instance, may have hitched a ride on rocks or soil that were
knocked into space by a meteorite impact. Astronomers had
initially assumed that most of the debris of a meteorite impact
would be superheated and sterilized, but the meteorite from
Mars containing organic molecules made them re-examine that
assumption. Although the immediate impact area of a collision
is intensely heated, the shock wave that travels out from the
impact site can launch substantial material at higher than the
escape velocity
Panspermia has a certain appeal; in that it suggests we may
have distant cousins on remote planets elsewhere in our Galaxy.
The theory was very popular in the 1920s, but critics point out
that it does not really simplify the problem of the origin of life,
it just shifts it elsewhere.

## **ARE WE ALONE**

Do other life forms exist in the Universe? Is there somewhere,
hundreds of light-years from Earth, a “student alien” reading a
book discussing the possibility of life on planets such as Earth?
Scientists do not know, and in fact they are strongly divided into
two groups. One group of scientists (many-worlders)
believes that millions of planets with life exist in
the Milky Way and that many of these have advanced civilizations.
The other group (“loners”) argues that we
are the only intelligent life in the Galaxy. Many-Worlders argue as follows: Earth-like planets are
common.
Life has formed on Earth. Therefore, it would be surprising
if life did not exist elsewhere. In fact, even if only a small
fraction of such planets has life, many advanced civilizations
probably exist. Such arguments may actually vastly underestimate
the number of habitable planets, because life forms elsewhere
may be able to live in environments intolerable to terrestrial
organisms. one can estimate
the number of civilizations by multiplying together the probability
of each condition necessary for it, a result now called
the Drake Equation. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the probabilities
is extremely uncertain, but they do help us to focus the
argument. It is interesting that even using fairly conservative estimates,
the equation suggests that many civilizations other than
ours exist in our Galaxy. Loners suggest that we are the only advanced life in the Milky
Way. They point out that any of the probabilities going into the
Drake equation could be much smaller than we have guessed.
Perhaps Earth-like planets are far rarer than we have estimated. Perhaps
evolution on other planets produces life forms that are so totally
unlike those of Earth that we could not recognize them as being
alive. if a civilization
had existed on Mars even as recently as 200 years ago,
we could not have communicated with them by radio, and if in
the meantime they destroyed themselves somehow, the chance
would have been lost forever. The loners also base their argument on the rapidity with
which our species has spread across Earth and the potential for
its rapid spread across the Milky Way. This argument was first
advanced by the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, and is often
called the Fermi Paradox. Fermi argued that given the increasing
rate of our technological advancement, it seems likely we
will develop the ability for interstellar travel within a thousand
years. And even if it takes us a thousand years to travel to a
nearby star, hopping from star to star, it will take only a few
million years to colonize our entire Galaxy. While this is long in
human terms, it is extremely short compared to the long history
of our Galaxy. The paradox Fermi pointed out is that if other
civilizations exist, they should have already arrived at Earth
long ago, and evidence of them would be plentiful. Thus, loners
argue, we are probably alone in the Milky Way. More-recent projects, called SETI (Search
for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence), use receivers that automatically
scan billions of radio wavelengths to search for signals
from other civilizations. One possible drawback to such searches is that other civilizations
might not be transmitting signals. Like us, they may
be listening. However, if other civilizations are like ours, they
inadvertently broadcast a wide range of signals.

## **THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE**

In 1961, Robert Dicke, a physicist at Princeton University,
wrote a paper concerning some remarkable cosmological coincidences.
Dicke noted, for example, that the age of the Universe
is very close to the lifetime of stars like the Sun and went on
to argue that this “coincidence” is in fact not remarkable at all.
Rather, it is a necessity if cosmologists are to exist to note it.
In 1974 the English physicist Brandon Carter took Dicke’s
idea further and proposed what he called the anthropic principle. According to the anthropic principle, “what we can
expect to observe must be restricted by the conditions necessary
for our presence as observers.”
According to the anthropic principle, the rude
reply is, “Of course conditions are just right for life. If they were
not, there would be no life here to do the marvelling.”
