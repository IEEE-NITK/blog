        <title>How are researchers and their research rated?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of research is continuously happening around us. While the word research seems fascinating to most of us, we seldom know how impactful the research is or how the actual impact of any research is measured. While there are many techniques for adjudging researchers, journals, and research papers, none is absolute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are four main ways that google scholar uses to rate a researcher. These are papers, citations, h-index, and i-10 index. Papers mean the number of research papers published by a researcher. More number of papers would mean a higher volume of research. Citations are the number of...</description>

        <title>An Introduction to Minimax Algorithm</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-minimax-algorithm&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Minimax Algorithm&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how a computer is able to play wisely in games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess and Go? It all boils down to the ever-evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI). Now, what if I say that building powerful AI for such games is easy? Yes, you read it right. We can design powerful AI that can play games much better than you, me or pretty much everyone. As a first step towards this, I would like to introduce you guys to a pretty simple, yet essential algorithm for this task - &lt;strong&gt;Minimax Algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-minimax-algorithm&quot;&gt;What is Minimax...</description>

        <title>EKRANOPLAN</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a closer look at the Ekranoplan &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/EKRANOPLAN/ekranoplan_resize_md.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ekranoplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Often referred to as the Caspian monster, the ekranoplan is one of the most freakish designs that were actually brought to life in a period where people were peaking at innovation in military hardware. It was designed to stay above the surface of water like a hovercraft but travel at far greater speeds like that of a commercial aeroplane. This was achieved with the help of an air cushion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hovercrafts have downward facing fans which generate the necessary lift while Ekranoplans used its wings and built up speed to...</description>

        <title>Communication Protocols Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider a multiplayer game that involves two or more participants. As there are many multiplayer games on an online platform, there’s always a need to be a proper collaboration between the players. A game is only as good as its rules, and how well we play the game is defined by how well we follow the rules. Often, players ignore these “protocols” and end up messing the system with no result and just chaos. From this, you may guess these “protocols” are not just a necessity in games, but most of the aspects of life. Users (which include...</description>

        <title>A Dive into Git Directory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Git is a distributed version control system. It means Git helps you manage different versions of your work, record the changes and helps different collaborators work parallelly on the same project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are working on a big project involving many files and folders in it. You make a series of changes to your project and now finally when you compile it, you see the application is crashing or not working as expected. In such a case, Git is the best tool you could use. If you have recorded all your changes uniformly in Git, you can any time...</description>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;genome-editing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GENOME EDITING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A genome is an organism’s complete set of DNAs, together with all of its genes. Every genome contains all the data required to create and maintain that organism.&lt;/em&gt; In humans, a replica of the whole genome (more than three billion DNA base pairs) is contained in all cells that have a nucleus. Modification to provide desired traits in plants, animals, and microbes used for food began around 10,000 years ago. These changes, in conjunction with natural evolutionary changes, have resulted in common food species that are currently genetically totally different from their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/Genome-Editing/figure1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Genome Editing&quot;...</description>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-machine-learning&quot;&gt;What is Machine Learning?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a school of computer science that focuses on programming machines to improve their performance through data and iteration. The machine can learn without being explicitly programmed. Yes, you read it right. This is called Artificial intelligence, where we feed in data into the machine, and it learns the data and predicts the output for any other input given. Machine learning is broadly classified into&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Supervised Learning In supervised learning, we have an idea of the relationship between the inputs and the outputs from the dataset given. It is further classified into...</description>

        <title>An Overview of Tarjan&apos;s Algorithm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Strong components in directed graphs are components in which all vertices are strongly connected to each other. 2 vertices A and B are strongly connected if there is a directed path from A-&amp;gt;B and B-&amp;gt;A.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for Computing Strongly Connected Components&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Computing strong components for graphs has been a need in computation since many years now. Biologists use the strong components to find out sub-ecosystems in a food chain. During the early advent of the internet, this became an absolute necessity as dependency graphs of various software modules needed to be processed and their strong components extracted,...</description>

One of the key concerns is the way in which they commute. Gone are the days when robots were restricted to moving in a pre-defined path, and one of the most fundamental technologies for locomotion of mobile robots are coverage algorithms. Coverage algorithms require that they allow the bot to cover the maximum area possible without any human intervention. In previously used algorithms, the coverage was achieved with robots crossing the entire length...</description>
